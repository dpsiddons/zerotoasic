# zerotoasic
A random pulse generator to be submitted to the ZerotoAsic project

It is based on a 32-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register. The register takes on a series of pseudo random values, which are compared to a threshold value. An output pulse is emitted whenever the random value is less than the threshold. Changing the threshold changes the frequency of the output pulses.
